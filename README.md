# AERI
This repo contains conference programs and files from AERI (Archival Education and Research Institute), as well as datasets compiled by the authors that were derived from the programs and websites of each of the institutes held between 2009-2017. 


## Background and Methods

The Building the Future of Archival Education and Research Initiative represents a collaborative effort amongst nine core U.S. academic institutions to stimulate the growth of a new generation of academics in archival education. The AERI project was initially developed with significant funding support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and is coordinated through the Center for Information as Evidence at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Given the nature of funding and support for the annual institute, each host/partner institution and organizing committee has used their own systems, organizational schemes, and methods for staging and providing access. This has presented some common incompatibilities, technical issues, and unfortunately, data loss. Whenever possible, we have used the site and information that was created and provided by the host committee as the primary source of information for this set of files. Those URLS are listed below, by year. If the original website created by the host institution/committee no longer exists, the UCLA AERI URL for that year has been used. Wikis and websites for the 2010 and 2011 AERIs are no longer publicly accessible or functional as of 2017.
Notes are also provided within the datasets where more than one source was used to determine the content.

In cases where the website has been removed or links are broken, we looked for information from the main AERI websites, hosted by UCLA. Those links are: 1) https://aeri.gseis.ucla.edu/index.htm  and 2) http://aeri.website/

In situations where information could still not be found, we reached out directly to the lead faculty/committee chair for the host institution for those years.
