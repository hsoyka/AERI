# AERI
This repo contains conference programs and files from AERI (Archival Education and Research Institute), as well as datasets compiled by the authors that were derived from the programs and websites of each of the institutes held between 2009-2017. 

Given the nature of the annual institute, each host institution and organizing committee has used their own systems, organizational schemes, and methods for staging and providing access. This has presented some common incompatibilities, technical issues, and unfortunately, data loss. Whenever possible, we have used the host committee site as the primary source of information for this set of files. Those URLS are listed below, by year. Notes are also provided where more than one source was used to determine the content.

In cases where the website has been removed or links are broken, we looked to the main AERI websites, hosted by UCLA. Those links are: 1) https://aeri.gseis.ucla.edu/index.htm  and 2) http://aeri.website/


In situations where information could still not be found, we reached out directly to the lead faculty/committee chair for the host institution for those years.
